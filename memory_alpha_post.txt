I'm writing a little script to practice making API calls for a programming class and used TOS credits as my dataset to do analysis upon in python using Pandas and TMDb. This is my first time on the wiki and I would love some recommendations of other bits of analysis to do and also whether or not to post the bits I've included below (feel free to post the bits I've got in whatever format is suitable if you'd like).

I can also share the code for anyone who's interested.

So far I've programmed it to find out which movies have the most TOS guest stars in them: Spartacus, and The Greatest Story Ever Told each have 6 (and there are more with fewer). And to find out which guest stars have starred with the most other guest stars and spit out pseudo edit-ready text for them:
