In 1965, he made his first appearance in the rejected Star Trek pilot, \"The Cage\", and would go on to play the character of Mr. Spock until 1969, followed by seven further films and a number of guest slots in various sequels. His character of Spock generated a significant cultural impact and three Emmy Award nominations; TV Guide named Spock one of the 50 greatest TV characters. Nimoy also had a recurring role in Mission: Impossible and a narrating role in Civilization IV, as well as several well-received stage appearances. Nimoy's fame as Spock is such that both his autobiographies, I Am Not Spock (1977) and I Am Spock (1995) detail his existence as being shared between the character and himself.\n\nNimoy was born to Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Iziaslav, Ukraine. His father, Max Nimoy, owned a barbershop in the Mattapan section of the city. His mother, Dora Nimoy (n\u00e9e Spinner), was a homemaker. Nimoy began acting at the age of eight in children's and neighborhood theater. His parents wanted him to attend college and pursue a stable career, or even learn to play the accordion\u2014which, his father advised, Nimoy could always make a living with\u2014but his grandfather encouraged him to become an actor.

Nimoy took Drama classes at Boston College in 1953 but failed to complete his studies, and in the 1970s studied photography at the University of California, Los Angeles.

DeForest was named after the pioneering electronics engineer Lee De Forest, and later named his Star Trek character's father \"David\" after his own. Kelley had an older brother, Ernest Casey Kelley. \n\nAs a child, he often played outside for hours at a time. Kelley was immersed in his father's mission in Conyers  and promised his father failure would mean \"wreck and ruin\". Before the  end of his first year at Conyers, Kelley was introduced into the  congregation to his musical talents and often sang solo in morning  church services. Eventually, this led to an appearance on the radio station WSB AM in Atlanta, Georgia. As a result of his radio work, he won an engagement with Lew Forbes and his orchestra at the Paramount Theater.\n\nIn  1934, the family left Conyers for the community of Decatur. He attended  the Decatur Boys High School where he played on the Decatur Bantams  baseball team. Kelley also played football and other sports. Before his  graduation, Kelley got a job as a drugstore car hop. He spent his  weekends working in the local theatres. Kelley graduated in 1938. \n\nDuring World War II, Kelley served as an enlisted man in the United States Army Air Forces between March 10, 1943, and January 28, 1946, assigned to the First Motion Picture Unit. After an extended stay in Long Beach, California,  Kelley decided to pursue an acting career and relocate to southern  California permanently, living for a time with his uncle Casey. He  worked as an usher in a local theater in order to earn enough money for  the move. Kelley's mother encouraged her son in his new career goal, but  his father disliked the idea. While in California, Kelley was spotted  by a Paramount Pictures scout while doing a United States Navy training film.", "popularity": 2.107142, "place_of_birth": "Atlanta, Georgia, USA", "profile_path": "/fUL1BY8XjLsQihueDD1UUAm0Qy6.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0001420", "homepage": null, "credits": {"cast": [{"character": "Dr. Leonard McCoy", "credit_id": "52fe421fc3a36847f8005a71", "poster_path": "/ys5Sgpc27mVo3H5zYLPV9LWDq5.jpg", "id": 152, "video": false, "vote_count": 559, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/w9iSKX1GSlaPPASW7jSFkFkkDnz.jpg", "genre_ids": [12, 9648, 878], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", "popularity": 11.92883, "title": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", "vote_average": 6.2, "overview": "When a destructive space entity is spotted approaching Earth, Admiral Kirk resumes command of the Starship Enterprise in order to intercept, examine, and hopefully stop it.", "release_date": "1979-12-06"}, {"character": "Dr. Leonard McCoy", "credit_id": "52fe421fc3a36847f8005c0b", "release_date": "1982-06-03", "vote_count": 714, "video": false, "adult": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "title": "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 878, 53], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan", "popularity": 7.137177, "id": 154, "backdrop_path": "/gih4L6m9u1yB3PGwyJxB5wjzbqR.jpg", "overview": "Admiral James T.

James Montgomery \"Jimmy\" Doohan ( March 3, 1920 \u2013 July 20, 2005) was a Canadian character and voice actor best known for his role as Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott in the television and film series Star Trek. Doohan's characterization of the Scottish Chief Engineer of the Starship Enterprise was one of the most recognizable elements in the Star Trek franchise, for which he also made several contributions behind the scenes. Many of the characterizations, mannerisms, and expressions that he established for Scotty and other Star Trek characters have become entrenched in popular culture.  Following his success with Star Trek, he supplemented his income and showed continued support for his fans by making numerous public appearances. Doohan often went to great lengths to buoy the large number of fans who have been inspired to make their own accomplishments in engineering and other fields, as a result of Doohan's work and his encouragement.
