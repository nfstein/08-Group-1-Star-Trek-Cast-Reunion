The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur).

His father was a vaudeville comedian and his mother was a chorine, showgirl.\n\nRichie, as he was affectionately called by friends, began his acting career under the name Jordan Grant; however, when he signed on with Universal Studios in 1957, he was told that he needed to change the name, because the studios already had one Mr. Grant (Cary Grant, that is) under contract. Roarke appeared in a number of television series during the late 50s and early 60s, including the role of Communications Officer Garrison in the original Star Trek pilot. He appeared in a string of AIP biker pictures along with Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Bruce Dern in the late 1960s, beginning with Hells Angels on Wheels (1967), and culminating with The Losers (subsequently retitled Nam's Angels) in 1970. In 1974, Roarke appeared in the financially-successful car chase film Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, with Fonda and Susan George, a role which showcased his range of acting skill despite the level of the material.\n\nHis \"breakout role\" came in 1980 when he portrayed Raymond Bailey, a self-important leading man whose stunt double was played by Steve Railsback in The Stunt Man. Peter O\u2019Toole befriended Roarke during filming, and the two became drinking buddies. Unfortunately, Roarke was unable to keep up with O\u2019Toole, and was hospitalized with delirium tremens before shooting was concluded. Word spread around Hollywood quickly, and Roarke had difficulty finding work as a result. However, an offer to work on a low-budget independent film brought him to Austin, Texas in 1982. At the time, Texas had a burgeoning movie industry\u2014billing itself as the \"Third Coast\"\u2014but lacked any real opportunities for aspiring film actors to learn their craft from industry veterans. Recognizing this need, Roarke opened the \"Film Actors Lab\" in the Dallas Communications Complex at the Studios in Las Colinas. \"Graduates\" of his program include Darryl Cox, Benton Jennings, Lar Park Lincoln and Lou Diamond Phillips.\n\nIn 1989, Roarke married Carla DeLane, and they had one child together. A child from Roarke\u2019s previous marriage, Jordan Gerler, was also an actor, appearing in Rolling Tunder in 1987. Roarke died in Euless, Texas of an apparent heart attack.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Adam Roarke, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "popularity": 1e-06, "place_of_birth": "Brooklyn, New York", "profile_path": "/5IdiAw6U0djj52cZ09Sx0hWUcHD.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0730126", "homepage": null, "credits": {"cast": [{"character": "Preacher", "credit_id": "52fe43dfc3a36847f80756a7", "release_date": "1970-07-15", "vote_count": 2, "video": false, "adult": false, "vote_average": 4.5, "title": "A Bullet for Pretty Boy", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 18, 53], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Bullet for Pretty Boy", "popularity": 1.004827, "id": 4882, "backdrop_path": "/1gdQZ1rAPCO1NHhLuCevN5BPTOc.jpg", "overview": "A biography of Charles \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd, a gangster who started his career at a young age after seeking revenge for his father's murder.", "poster_path": "/sUQCGPfXN5o2aNMvVbHscBMYOVW.jpg"}, {"character": "Matt MacDonald", "credit_id": "52fe4461c3a36847f8092939", "poster_path": "/jnbUOe6dAXK4Hs6dhYgvmdr5CbO.jpg", "id": 6644, "video": false, "vote_count": 103, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/1PODaFULjnsbkgirmFfm9i0cJB1.jpg", "genre_ids": [37], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "El Dorado", "popularity": 7.306908, "title": "El Dorado", "vote_average": 7.3, "overview": "Cole Thornton, a gunfighter for hire, joins forces with an old friend, Sheriff J.P.

He was born in Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar). Sofaer's strong features and resonant voice complemented the many exotic character parts he played. He began his acting career on the London stage in 1921, but soon was alternating between London and Broadway. By the 1930s, he was appearing in both British and American films. Among his more prominent performances were the dual role of the Judge and Surgeon in Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and St. Paul in Quo Vadis (1951). He also appeared on television from its earliest days in the late 1930s and on radio. Although his film appearances diminished after the 1950s, he continued to have guest roles on dozens of major U.S. television series throughout the 1960s, including Star Trek (\"Charlie X\"), The Twilight Zone (\"The Mighty Casey\"), Lost in Space (\"The Flaming Planet\") and The Outer Limits (\"Demon with a Glass Hand\"), until retiring in the mid 1970s. He may be best-remembered for his recurring role as Hadji, the master of all genies, on I Dream of Jeannie. Sofaer married Psyche Angela Christian, with whom he had two sons and four daughters. He died in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, as the result of congestive heart failure in 1988. The noted jurist of the same name is the son of one of the actor's cousins.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Abraham Sofaer, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "popularity": 2.9e-05, "place_of_birth": "Rangoon, Burma.

In high school,  he was elected president of the Drama Club. He went to work on Wall  Street as a runner shortly after the 1929 crash. James Gregory performed  in drama groups and achieved pro status as a summer stock player in  1935. He performed in plays throughout New York, New Jersey and  Maryland. His troupe of performers toured small towns in Pennsylvania  and West Virginia, towing a trailer full of theatre props; they  performed in school gyms, churches and YMCAs, earning $25 for a week of  one-night stands. In 1939, James Gregory made his Broadway debut in a  production of \"Key Largo\". Over the next 16 years, he performed in  approximately 25 Broadway productions. (His career was interrupted by  W.W.II; he served for 3 years in the Navy and Marine Corps. His tour of  duty took him to the Pacific where he spent 83 days on Okinawa.) One  good thing that came out of the war years is that he married Anne in  1944, and they would stay together always. During his Broadway career,  James Gregory earned consistently favorable reviews by drama critics  from the New York Press, Boston Globe, New York Times, Chicago Tribune,  Hollywood Reporter and Variety. James Gregory did a few TV spots as  early as 1951, and in 1955 he made the transition from the Broadway  stage to live television. The following year, after a couple of earlier  uncredited movie appearances, he would also begin his movie career in  earnest. He worked steadily throughout the early years of TV, working  for major live television productions from New York to Hollywood. In  1959, James Gregory made television history by costarring in the pilot  episode of the The Twilight Zone  (1959); the episode \"Where Is Everybody?\" concerning the relevant topic  of the USA winning the space race by sending a manned spaceship to the  moon sold the series. James Gregory would play Dean Martin's exasperated boss MacDonald in the first 3 of the Matt Helm movies: The Silencers (1966), Murderers' Row (1966) and The Ambushers (1967). But he won his biggest acclaim as Inspector Frank Luger for the entire run of the TV series Barney Miller  (1974) (1975-1982). This was his signature role; as the Inspector, he  would be lovable, irritating, ingratiating, exasperating and humorous,  sometimes all at the same time. He was Barney's buddy for 7 years, and  the series ended with the Inspector getting himself a mail-order bride.  James Gregory retired from acting in 1983, with over 100 TV and movie  credits. He has entertained, uplifted and captivated us with his  performances. He has endeared himself to a legion of fans. When asked to  define his life's work, he simply said, \"I am an actor\". Fans would  disagree with him. James Gregory is so much more -- role model and  inspiration.", "popularity": 0.857294, "place_of_birth": "Bronx, New York, USA", "profile_path": "/xOpEhGx9Qupfdfo3KUaA0DHxbko.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0339834", "homepage": null, "credits": {"cast": [{"character": "Sen.

He was an imposing, powerfully built figure noted for his flashy portrayals of screen villains.\n\nHe was educated in England at Bedford School and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He worked as a schoolmaster before first appearing on the London stage in 1927 and then entering British films in 1934. He appeared in the 1937 Old Vic stage production of Hamlet, in which Laurence Olivier made his first appearance in the title role, opposite Vivien Leigh as Ophelia. During the Second World War, he served with the Royal Artillery and was demobilized with the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nThatcher appeared in classic British films of the late 1930s and 1940s, including Major Barbara (1941) and Great Expectations (1946), in which he played Bentley Drummle. He moved to Hollywood in the 1950s. He was constantly in demand, invariably lending his looming figure and baleful countenance to sinister or stern roles in popular costume thrillers such as The Crimson Pirate (1952), Blackbeard the Pirate (1952), The Robe (1953) (as the disapproving father of Richard Burton's character), The Black Shield of Falworth (1954), Helen of Troy (1956), Darby's Rangers (1958), and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958). He also appeared in the Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard 1962 remake of Mutiny on the Bounty.\n\nHe returned to the stage quite frequently, notably on Broadway, in such esteemed productions as Edward, My Son (1948), That Lady (1949) and Billy Budd (1951). In 1959, he portrayed Captain Keller in the award-winning play The Miracle Worker with Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke. All of these plays were filmed, but Thatcher did not appear in the movie versions.\n\nAlso a steady fixture on television, he appeared in such made-for-TV films as adaptations of A. J. Cronin's Beyond This Place (1957) and The Citadel (1960),Bonanza(1961), and Brenda Starr (1976). He also played the title role in a Philco Television Playhouse version of Othello and acted in a CBS production of Beyond This Place (1957).\n\nThatcher died of cancer on March 4, 1981, in Thousand Oaks, California, in the Los Angeles area.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Torin Thatcher, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "popularity": 0.008506, "place_of_birth": "Bombay, British India, India", "profile_path": "/vO8Dw33jVxVU3gR1FWbgomrEmRB.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0857147", "homepage": null, "credits": {"cast": [{"character": "Sir Turnbull", "credit_id": "52fe437dc3a36847f805816f", "release_date": "1968-01-07", "vote_count": 0, "video": false, "adult": false, "vote_average": 0, "title": "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", "genre_ids": [18, 878, 53], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", "popularity": 1.209417, "id": 3024, "backdrop_path": null, "overview": "No overview found.", "poster_path": "/8byiRQ9kv2TUGnav5Ki633duB3s.jpg"}, {"character": "Johnson", "credit_id": "52fe43c3c3a36847f806db5b", "release_date": "1952-08-18", "vote_count": 18, "video": false, "adult": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "The Snows of Kilimanjaro", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 18, 10749], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Snows of Kilimanjaro", "popularity": 2.487501, "id": 4460, "backdrop_path": "/9AT3J21ffNYEvfqqI4SN2RVJseX.jpg", "overview": "Writer Harry Street reflects on his life as he lies dying from an infection while on safari in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro.", "poster_path": "/s4Fg4d9iGKeMrWfpmd8lnOToqsN.jpg"}, {"character": "Policeman", "credit_id": "52fe4422c3a368484e011637", "release_date": "1948-09-30", "vote_count": 32, "video": false, "adult": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "The Fallen Idol", "genre_ids": [18, 9648, 53], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Fallen Idol", "popularity": 3.386416, "id": 21631, "backdrop_path": "/gNgd7ZSj3sgpmnSPxhZKoF3rh7X.jpg", "overview": "The film is told through the naive eyes of a diplomat's young son, Phillipe, who idolises his best friend, the diplomat's butler Baines.

Many of the actors in Tinytown were part of a performing troupe called Singer's Midgets, who also played Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz, released in 1939.\n\nHe also had a starring role in American International Pictures' 1973 release, Little Cigars, about a gang of \"midgets\" on a crime spree.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Billy Curtis, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b", "popularity": 0.17747, "place_of_birth": "United States Springfield, Massachusetts,", "profile_path": "/dlvmolruFp5cq7ARO19WMKHFmbD.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0193260", "homepage": null, "credits": {"cast": [{"character": "Midget", "credit_id": "52fe44989251416c91016233", "poster_path": "/pBBgIy2ncPgX5lRtYsWm0BmMFjg.jpg", "id": 31682, "video": false, "vote_count": 91, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pZ75L6epfBTvlzf4RuMGhAMDpt9.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 878, 53], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Incredible Shrinking Man", "popularity": 5.587875, "title": "The Incredible Shrinking Man", "vote_average": 7.3, "overview": "When exposure to a combination of radiation and insecticide causes Scott Carey to begin to shrink medical science is powerless to help him.", "release_date": "1957-02-22"}, {"character": "Mordecai", "credit_id": "52fe449e9251416c7503b0c7", "release_date": "1973-04-19", "vote_count": 273, "video": false, "adult": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "title": "High Plains Drifter", "genre_ids": [37], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "High Plains Drifter", "popularity": 8.594262, "id": 11901, "backdrop_path": "/hST5A6ljJWlbyz5kbh6JV2WONzU.jpg", "overview": "A gunfighting stranger comes to the small settlement of Lago.

Wyatt was a three-time Emmy Award-winner.\n\nJane Waddington Wyatt was born on August 12, 1910 in Mahwah, New Jersey, but raised in Manhattan. Her father, Christopher Billopp Wyatt, Jr., was a Wall Street investment banker, and her mother, the former Euphemia Van Rensselaer Waddington, was a drama critic for the Catholic World. Both of her parents were Roman Catholic converts.\n\nShe made her film debut in 1934 in One More River. In arguably her most famous role, she co-starred as Ronald Colman's character's love interest in Frank Capra's Columbia Pictures film Lost Horizon (1937).\n\nOther film appearances included Gentleman's Agreement with Gregory Peck, None but the Lonely Heart with Cary Grant, Boomerang with Dana Andrews, and Our Very Own. Her film career suffered because of her outspoken opposition to Senator Joseph McCarthy, the chief figure in the anti-Communist investigations of that era, and was temporarily derailed for having assisted in hosting a performance by the Bolshoi Ballet during the Second World War, even though it was at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Wyatt returned to her roots on the New York stage for a time and appeared in such plays as Lillian Hellman's The Autumn Garden, opposite Fredric March.\n\nFor many people, Wyatt is best remembered as Margaret Anderson on Father Knows Best, which aired from 1954 to 1960. She played opposite Robert Young as the devoted wife and mother of the Anderson family in the Midwestern town of Springfield. This role won Wyatt three Emmy Awards for best actress in a comedy series. After Father Knows Best, Wyatt guest starred in several other series.\n\nOn June 13, 1962, she was cast in the lead in \"The Heather Mahoney Story\" on NBC's Wagon Train. In 1963, she portrayed Kitty McMullen in \"Don't Forget to Say Goodbye\" on the ABC drama, Going My Way, with Gene Kelly and Leo G. Carroll, a series about the Catholic priesthood in New York City. In 1965, Wyatt was cast as Anne White in \"The Monkey's Paw \u2013 A Retelling\" on CBS's The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.\n\nWyatt was married to investment broker Edgar Bethune Ward from November 9, 1935, until his death on November 8, 2000, just one day short of the couple's 65th wedding anniversary. The couple reportedly met in the late 1920s when both were weekend houseguests of Franklin D. Roosevelt at Hyde Park, New York. Ward later converted to the Catholic faith of his wife. Wyatt suffered a mild stroke in the 1990s, but recovered well. She remained in relatively good health for the rest of her life\n\nJane Wyatt died on October 20, 2006 of natural causes at her home in Bel-Air, California, aged 96. She was interred at San Fernando Mission Cemetery, next to her husband.", "popularity": 0.860439, "place_of_birth": "Campgaw, New Jersey, USA", "profile_path": "/blYpLJKupFFi6QKqfMWJvN2hkpn.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0943553", "homepage": null, "credits": {"cast": [{"character": "Amanda", "credit_id": "52fe4221c3a36847f80066c3", "release_date": "1986-11-25", "vote_count": 501, "video": false, "adult": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "title": "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home", "genre_ids": [12, 878], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home", "popularity": 10.453334, "id": 168, "backdrop_path": "/2SmriSA5l4WE40KnZ8mA0GuqtEJ.jpg", "overview": "Fugitives of the Federation for their daring rescue of Spock from the doomed Genesis Planet, Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and his crew begin their journey home to face justice for their actions.

In other words, most of his roles were rather  small. On television, conversely, he proved himself quite a  scene-stealer, particularly in the 1960's and early 70's, when his face  appeared on just about every major show. He was at his best as pool  hustler Sure-shot Wilson in an episode of The Odd Couple (1970), Rollo, a quirky time-traveling scientist on Twilight Zone (1959), and - famously - as 'asteroid detecting', tribble dealing galactic entrepreneur Cyrano Jones on Star Trek (1966). Alas, he was also a space carrot named Tybo on Lost in Space (1965)....\n\nHis  suicide in April 1977 has been attributed to severe depression as a  result of a back injury, sustained earlier in the decade.

Until 1934, he worked as a theatre actor. Wolfe mostly found work as a character actor, appearing in over 270 films. He and his wife, Elizabeth, had two daughters.\n\nWolfe was also a veteran of World War I where he served as a medical sergeant in the National Army of the United States. His service number was 2371377.\n\nAlthough American by birth and upbringing, Wolfe was often cast as an Englishman: his stage experience endowed him with precise diction resembling an upper-class British accent. A receding hairline and etched features at a relatively early age allowed him to play older men before he actually grew old. Wolfe found a niche as a soft-spoken learned man, and his over 250 roles included many attorneys, judges, butlers, ministers, professors, and doctors.\n\nWolfe's best-known role may have been in the 1946 movie Bedlam, in which he played a scientist confined to an asylum.\n\nWolfe wrote and self-published two books of poetry Forty-Four Scribbles and a Prayer: Lyrics and Ballads and Sixty Ballads and Lyrics In Search of Music.\n\nOf note to science fiction fans, Ian Wolfe appeared in two episodes of the original Star Trek television series: \"Bread and Circuses\" (1968) as Septimus, and \"All Our Yesterdays\" (1969) as Mr. Atoz, and portrayed the wizard Traquil in the cult series Wizards and Warriors.\n\nIn 1982, Wolfe had a small recurring role on the TV series WKRP in Cincinnati as Hirsch, the sarcastic, irreverent butler to WKRP owner Lillian Carlson.\n\nWolfe, who worked until the last couple of years of his life, died January 23, 1992, at age 95, of natural causes. He was cremated.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ian Wolfe, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "popularity": 0.602406, "place_of_birth": "Canton, Illinois, USA", "profile_path": "/ylp7puM2Hcd0VkQvXfmD7zkP4m7.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0938052", "homepage": null, "credits": {"cast": [{"character": "Dr. Minton (lecturer at planetarium)", "credit_id": "52fe4228c3a36847f80087ab", "poster_path": "/bEAoNvtqvO0c2lItNkKlKUqhPuw.jpg", "id": 221, "video": false, "vote_count": 369, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/aFrfCpEwyyAhIbooDANgWiFzV9R.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rebel Without a Cause", "popularity": 9.908136, "title": "Rebel Without a Cause", "vote_average": 7.6, "overview": "After moving to a new town, troublemaking teen Jim Stark is supposed to have a clean slate, although being the new kid in town brings its own problems.

During the first two decades of the 20th century the film concerns a family vaudeville troupe headed by patriarch Pete Monahan (Jack Oakie). Because of his love affair with the bottle, Pete manages to get himself and his family blacklisted from every major vaude house in the country.

He eventually landed in Hollywood in the late '20s, during the era of part-silent, part-talkie movies, and (because his accent was mistaken for English) he played young Englishmen in some of his first films. He soon drifted into stuntwork, regularly doubling cowboy star\u00a0William Boyd\u00a0and putting a red toupee over his own blond hair to double 'Red Skelton', among others. Some of his most notable stunt jobs were in the sci-fi/horror field. He doubled star\u00a0Bruce Cabotthroughout\u00a0King Kong\u00a0(1933), stood in for\u00a0Spencer Tracy\u00a0as Mr. Hyde in\u00a0Dr. Jekyll et Mr. Hyde\u00a0(1941) and replaced\u00a0Bela Lugosi\u00a0as the Monster in the climactic battle sequence of\u00a0Frankenstein rencontre le loup-garou\u00a0(1943). In addition to his feature films, Perkins turned up regularly in serials and on TV. On many occasions he worked with special effects and rigging departments, setting up large action scenes. By the 1960s he was doing more acting than stunts; he \"officially\" retired in 1972, although he took a number of subsequent jobs.  - IMDb Mini Biography", "popularity": 0.001859, "place_of_birth": "Melbourne, Victoria, Australia", "profile_path": "/7c4i1XqGWrIV1DMNR7zkkBhvPkM.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0673945", "homepage": null, "credits": {"cast": [{"character": "Bluebeard", "credit_id": "54f57c0f9251412ba700124c", "release_date": "1966-07-30", "vote_count": 224, "video": false, "adult": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "Batman", "genre_ids": [12, 35, 80, 878, 10751], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Batman", "popularity": 6.881267, "id": 2661, "backdrop_path": "/5gcdof2PKH1emllBdN1VXU706IP.jpg", "overview": "The Dynamic Duo faces four super-villains who plan to hold the world for ransom with the help of a secret invention that instantly dehydrates people.", "poster_path": "/udDVJXtAFsQ8DimrXkVFqy4DGEQ.jpg"}, {"character": "Factory Workman", "credit_id": "55d51206c3a3684d9e0003ab", "poster_path": "/hzWUZ20wayJO1DvfPvunQmZuAKE.jpg", "id": 47404, "video": false, "vote_count": 1, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ApyOPHkY6P9beIJO2Ep5puQdNXs.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 18, 9648], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Nick Carter, Master Detective", "popularity": 1.468777, "title": "Nick Carter, Master Detective", "vote_average": 6, "overview": "Detective Nick Carter is brought in to foil spies at the Radex Airplane Factory, where a new fighter plane is under manufacture.", "release_date": "1939-12-15"}, {"character": "Native Cop", "credit_id": "55d51253c3a368507f002eb1", "release_date": "1936-10-02", "vote_count": 1, "video": false, "adult": false, "vote_average": 7, "title": "Mummy's Boys", "genre_ids": [35], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Mummy's Boys", "popularity": 1.049255, "id": 84454, "backdrop_path": "/n1RxNVhIqS0XcXaAeSWcHrUASqC.jpg", "overview": "Wheeler &amp; Woolsey comedy about two moronic ditch diggers, recruited for an archaeology expedition, getting mixed up with jewel thieves and an ancient Egyptian \"curse.\"", "poster_path": "/vpxEKQXx9z2hTTn96sgUMVF6qpc.jpg"}, {"character": "Tarn / Doctor", "credit_id": "55d44fa7c3a3685082001904", "release_date": "1961-10-31", "vote_count": 1, "video": false, "adult": false, "vote_average": 5, "title": "Valley of the Dragons", "genre_ids": [878], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Valley of the Dragons", "popularity": 1.945335, "id": 87966, "backdrop_path": "/mCYgyAeaXdVs3xAIaniXk2VTg2Z.jpg", "overview": "In 1881, Michael Denning, an American soldier, and Hector Servadac, a French aristocrat, are about to have a duel over a woman that they both are infatuated with.

The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur).

After quitting high school to join the United States Army, Evers was so inspired by stars like John Wayne (whom he would later appear with in The Green Berets) that he decided to try acting. A stint on Broadway led to Hollywood, where his first big break was the 1960 NBC series western Wrangler. On June 30, 1960, he appeared on NBC's The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.[1]\n\nIn 1963-1964, Evers starred as 41-year-old Professor Howe in the 26-episode ABC drama Channing, based on life on a college campus, with co-star Henry Jones (1912-1999).\n\nEvers' most enduring role derived from the 1959 B-movie classic The Brain That Wouldn't Die, which was not released until 1962.\n\nIn 1966, Evers appeared on the episode \"The Insider\" of NBC's The Road West starring Barry Sullivan as the patriarch of a family of pioneers relocated to Kansas. From 1967-1969, he appeared sporadically as James Sonnett, the missing son sought by the Walter Brennan character, Will Sonnett, in ABC's The Guns of Will Sonnett. Dack Rambo co-starred as Evers' son and Brennan's grandson, Jeff Sonnett.\n\nEvers continued to garner parts in films and television, having guest starred with Bruce Lee in the Green Hornet episode \"Eat, Drink and be Dead\" (1966), but they were of an increasingly minor nature. Evers also appeared as a race car driver and a romantic interest of Doris Martin in The Doris Day Show in 1970. His final film appearance was in 1990 in Basket Case 2. He returned to New York in his later years. He was married to actress Shirley Ballard from 1953 until his death.\n\nEvers died of heart failure in Los Angeles. He was also survived by a sister and a cousin.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jason Evers, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "popularity": 0.001662, "place_of_birth": "New York City, New York", "profile_path": "/18UezS7VTmEd3WQ4R7kizPKgeNd.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0263645", "homepage": null, "credits": {"cast": [{"character": "E-2", "credit_id": "52fe430cc3a36847f8036861", "poster_path": "/yOnN43HdxvV5h5U4qsGIfeUL0Zv.jpg", "id": 1687, "video": false, "vote_count": 280, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/cZptXKK7yOq6WRtDoAHUozjEOjF.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 878], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Escape from the Planet of the Apes", "popularity": 11.386872, "title": "Escape from the Planet of the Apes", "vote_average": 6.3, "overview": "The world is shocked by the appearance of two talking chimpanzees, who arrived mysteriously in a U.S. spacecraft.
