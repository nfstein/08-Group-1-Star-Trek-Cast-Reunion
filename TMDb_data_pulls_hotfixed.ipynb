    "# Guidelines for Project 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This document contains guidelines, requirements, and suggestions for Project 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Team Effort\n",
    "\n",
    "Before anything, remember that Projects are a **group effort**: Working closely with your teammates is a requirement. This both helps teach real-world collaborative workflows, and enables you to tackle more difficult problems than you'd be able to working alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, working in groups allows you to **work smart** and **dream big**. Take advantage of it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This helps provide direction and prevent [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The kind of data you'd like to work with/field you're interested in (e.g., geodata, weather data, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Possible source for such data\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, write down what kind of data you plan to work with, and what kinds of questions you'd like to ask of it. This constitutes your Project Proposal/Outline, and should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our project is to uncover patterns in criminal activity around Los Angeles. We'll examine relationships between types of crime and location; crime rates and times of day; trends in crime rates over the course of the year; and related questions, as the data admits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your group has written an outline, it's time to start hunting for data. You are free to use data from any source, but we recommend the following curated sources of high-quality data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [data.world](https://data.world/)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov)\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are you'll have to update your Project Outline as you explore the available data. **This is fine**&mdash;adjustments like this are part of the process! Just make sure everyone in the group is up-to-speed on the goals of the project as you make changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleanup &amp; Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "With data in hand, it's time to tackle development and analysis. This is where the fun starts!\n",
    "\n",
    "Inevitably, the analysis process can be broken into two broad phases: **Exploration &amp; Cleanup** and **Analysis** proper.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've learned, you'll need to explore, clean, and reformat your data before you can begin to answer your research questions. We recommend keeping track of these exploration and cleanup steps in a dedicated Jupyter Notebook, both for organization's sake and to make it easier to  present your work later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, after you've massaged your data and are ready to start crunching numbers, you should keep track of your work in a Jupyter Notebook dedicated specifically to analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "During both phases, **don't forget to include plots**! Don't make the mistake of waiting to build figures until you're preparing your presentation. Creating them along the way can reveal insights and interesting trends in the data that you might not notice otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, be sure that your projects meet the [technical requirements](TechnicalRequirements.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've analyzed your data to your satisfaction, you'll put together a presentation to show of your work, explain your process, and discuss your conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This presentation will be delivered as a slideshow, and should give your classmates and instructional staff an overview of your work. PowerPoint, Keynote, and Google Slides are all acceptable for building slides. \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as your slides meet the [presentation requirements](PresentationRequirements.md), you are free to structure the presentation however you wish, but students are often successful with the format laid out in the [presentation guidelines](PresentationGuidelines.md).\n",
    "\n",

Cmdr. Ro Nevin in a loose retelling of Homer's classic story of The Odyssey, set in the 24th century universe of Star Trek.\\n\\nRo was involved in numerous episodes of the Star Trek: Hidden Frontier series, and was in the first gay plotlines during the second season of Hidden Frontier. Caves has said that although Ro is an openly gay/bisexual character, the new series \\\"will focus instead on new aspects of his evolving persona that have not been explored yet in Hidden Frontier\\\".\",\n",
